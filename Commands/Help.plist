This README just documents what the commands of this Bundle do and how you can &lt;a href="#sect_2"&gt;fine-tune&lt;/a&gt; their behaviour; if you need general SVK Help/Introduction, you should look at the &lt;a href="http://svk.elixus.org/"&gt;SVK homepage&lt;/a&gt;.
      
# Commands
         
-   **Add to Repository**

    __Target__:  selected project files/folders or the active file if it doesn't belong to a project
    
    Adds the targets to the repository.

-   **Blame**

    __Target__:  active file
        
    Displays a line-by-line history of the file, showing you who wrote which line in what revision.  Click a line to jump to it in an editor window.  Hover over a revision number or author name to see when the corresponding line was last changed. The date format is &lt;a href="#sect_2"&gt;adjustable&lt;/a&gt; with `TM_SVK_DATE_FORMAT`.
    
    "wc" means the last change was in your working copy.

-   **Commit**

    __Target__:  selected project files/folders or the active file if it doesn't belong to a project
    
    Commits your changed files to the repository. A dialog asks you for the description of your changes; you may also choose to exclude files from the commit by un-checking them. If no files are selected or active, this command does nothing. If the target files have no local changes, nothing happens.
    
-   **Diff With Working Copy (BASE)**
    
    __Target__:  active file
    
    Displays the differences between the active file and an unaltered, pristine copy of the file at the same revision.
    
    Equivalent to `svk diff -rBASE`
        
-   **Info**

    __Target__:  selected project files/folders or the active file if it doesn't belong to a project

    Displays detailed information about the selected files. Some parameters are configurable via shell variables; see the &lt;a href="#sect_2"&gt;Configuration Options&lt;/a&gt; section below.
    
-   **Log**

    __Target__:  selected project files/folders or the active file if it doesn't belong to a project
    
    Displays the commit message history for the selected files. Some parameters are configurable via shell variables; see the &lt;a href="#sect_2"&gt;Configuration Options&lt;/a&gt; section below.  (TODO: if multiple files are selected, only the logs from the first are shown.)

-   **Revert**

    __Target__:  active file
    
    Revert changes made in checkout copies.

-   **Status**

    __Target__:  directory of active file
    
    Displays a list of files with changes in your working copy, along with the type of change for each file.

-   **Update to Newest**

    __Target__:  selected project files/folders or the active file if it doesn't belong to a project
    
    Updates the targets with the newest changes from the repository.


# Configuration Options
         
These [static variables](?static_variables) allow you to tweak the behaviour of the certain commands if need be. The default values should make sense for normal use.
         
-   `TM_SVK`

    __Default__: `svk`
    
    The path to your svk executable.
            
-   `TM_RUBY`

    __Default__: `ruby`
    
    Here you can tweak with what Ruby the formatting scripts will be executed.
            
-   `TM_SVK_DATE_FORMAT`

    __Default__: *not set* (No Changes, just show what SVK shows)
                  
    A date format string that allows you to tweak the format in which Blame, Log and Info show you dates.  See &lt;a title="Manual Page For strftime(3)" href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/strftime.3.html"&gt;strftime(3)&lt;/a&gt; for what you can enter here.
            
-   `TM_SVK_CLOSE`

    __Default__: `false`
    
	With this option you can adjust whether the windows of Blame and Info close if you click on a link which opens a file in TM.  Set it to `1` or `true` if windows should close or to something else if they should not.
            
-   `TM_SVK_LOG_RANGE`

    __Default__: `BASE:1`

    The default range to query for log messages.
            
-   `TM_SVK_LOG_LIMIT`

    __Default__: `9`

    The number of messages to show. `0` means no limit.
            
-   `TM_SVK_INFO_HIDE`

    __Default__: *not set* (nothing)
    
    Here you can adjust what keys of the info stream you don't want to see, it is case insensitive and a comma (`,`) separated list.  If you enter a `*`, it is assumed that you want to hide all vars, if so, you can make some values visible again with `TM_SVK_INFO_SHOW`.
            
-   `TM_SVK_INFO_SHOW`

    __Default__: *not set* (everything else)
    
    This is also a comma-separated list of keys, it just makes sense if you did hide all with the above var. `*` has no special meaning here. Everything you enter here will be shown if you want to hide everything else.
